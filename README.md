- 👋 Hi, I’m Karl (@karlmoor-cisco)
- 💪 I'm a hands on engineer/architect and I like to focus on getting things done!
- 🌱 I’m interested in all aspects of software from design, development, QA, achitecture, DevOps. If there's something to know, I'm interested.
- 💞️ I like solving problems. If I can help, I'm happy to, but just remember I might be helping a bunch more people so don't nag.
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - Webex
 - 😄 Pronouns: he/him

Some things I've learned (and try my best to practice) to help communicate more effectively...

- [Don't just say "hello"](https://nohello.net/en/) - I work for a global company, if you send me just a "hello!" outside my working hours, I'm not going to see it until the next day, which isn't a good use of anyone's time. Help me answer your questions more quickly by just asking them outright. I **promise** I won't think you're rude if we don't exchange a full three-way handshake of pleasantries first.
- In a similar vein, [don't ask to ask](https://dontasktoask.com/), just put the question out there, whether privately or publicly, but...
- Preferably publicly. We have a lot of Webex spaces, with a lot of really knowledgable people. Questions almost always belong in a public space. If it isn't something that only I can answer then you'll probably get your answer much quicker. And if it **is** something that only I can answer, it'll still be there for me to answer the next day as soon as I see it.
- In a nod to my troubleshooting heritage, [the X/Y problem](https://xyproblem.info/) is a useful concept to be aware of. When you're having a problem, ask questions about **the problem**, not about what **you perceive** as the solution. This has some advantages:
  - Maybe your solution is not going to solve the actual problem, or it will cause different problems. If you explain **the problem** then people can work together with you on finding the _best_ available solution
  - Articulating your problem (particularly in text) can also be a form of [rubber ducking](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/); maybe halfway through writing your message about **the problem** you solve the problem yourself, which is unlikely to happen when you're instead writing a message about a solution that you don't know how to implement
